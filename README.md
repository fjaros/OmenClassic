# Omen Classic
World of Warcraft Classic Port of Omen Threat Meter.

Forked from [Omen Threat Meter](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/omen-threat-meter) v2.0.4 by Xinhuan, the latest TBC release before Blizzard implemented Threat API available to addons, making user-made threat libraries obsolote.

OmenClassic is compatbile with ThreatClassic2 and TinyThreat since all three use [LibThreatClassic2](https://github.com/dfherr/LibThreatClassic2).

LibThreatClassic2 often reports misleading threat indicators and so I've done a lot of work to try to ignore those in all of Omen's modes. Bugs are expected, I will fix them as I get feedback.
